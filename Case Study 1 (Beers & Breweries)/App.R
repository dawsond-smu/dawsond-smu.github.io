##1. Let the user read in the data (the Beer Data.) 

##2. Let the user make a histogram of the IBU

##3. Let the user make a histogram of the ABV  (separate histogram)

##4. Low the user switch back and forth between histograms and boxplots to represent this information.  You could do this with a radio button that switches the plot from histogram to boxplot â€¦ the implementation however is up to you.  

##5. Allow the user to filter the histograms / boxplots above by state. 

##6. In addition to the histograms, add a scatter plot of IBU v. ABV

##7. Add the ability to add or take off the simple linear regression line. 

##8. Allow the user to filter the data on the scatter plot by state.

##9. Add at least one additional plot from your analysis and make sure to clearly label and/or describe the information it is conveying.
