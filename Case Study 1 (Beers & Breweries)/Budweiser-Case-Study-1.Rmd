Data from csv. (Breweries & Beers)
1) There are 558 Breweries in all 50 states.
2) There are 2410 Beers in the data. 
3) 1405 records remain post removal of records with 'NA'.
4) Variables of Analysis: State, ABV (Alcohol content by volume), IBU (Internaltional bitterness value), Container Size (Oz), & Count of Breweries/Beers.
5) Correlation between 

1.   How many breweries are present in each state?
```{r echo=FALSE}

```
2.   Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.  (RMD only, this does not need to be included in the presentation or the deck.)
```{r echo=FALSE}
Beers_Brewery = merge(Beers,Breweries, by.x = "Brewery_id", by.y = "Brew_ID")
First6_Beers_Brewery = Beers_Brewery %>% head(6)
First6_Beers_Brewery
Last6_Beers_Brewery = Beers_Brewery %>% tail(6)
Last6_Beers_Brewery
```
3.   Address the missing values in each columns.
```{r echo=FALSE}
##Remove any column with 'NA' from Table
Beers_Brewery_Omit = na.omit(Beers_Brewery)
cat("There are",dim(Beers_Brewery)[1],"rows before removing all rows with 'NA' from the Beer-Brewery data and",dim(Beers_Brewery_Omit)[1],"thereafter.")
```
4.   Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare. 
5.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
```{r echo=FALSE}
## Summerise the data based on median ABV and IBU

```


6.   Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
```{r}
###Summary Statistics & Distribution 
Summary_Base %>% select(IBU, ABV) %>% ggpairs() + labs(main = "ABV by IBU Distribution")
###Correlation test
cor.test(Summary_Base$ABV, Summary_Base$IBU) ## Pearson correlation
ggplot(data= Summary_Base, aes(x=ABV, y = IBU)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = lm) +
  ggtitle("Scatter plot w/ smoothline") +
  xlab("ABV") +
  ylab("IBU")
##ABV has slight left skew, while IBU is the opposite, but are close to normally distributed. Histrogram corroborates that the data normality, though it is slightly left skewed. The alcoholic content is moderately and positively correlated with the bitterness of the beer. Plot further illustrates the notion.
```

7.   Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

```{r echo=FALSE}
Summary_Base %>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV, y=IBU)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm) + ggtitle("Distribution of ABV by Bitterness (IBU)") + xlab("ABV") + ylab("IBU")
Model = lm(ABV ~ IBU, Summary_Base)
summary(Model)
#There is significant relationship between ABV & Bitterness (p-value < 2.2e-16 @ alpha = .05). It is estimated that 45% of alcoholic content is explained by bitterness.
```

8.  Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.

```{r echo=FALSE}
##Identify all beers containing stand alone word "ALE" ignoring case.
Ale_Beers = Beers_Brewery_Omit %>% filter(grepl("\\bALE\\b",Style, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>% mutate(IPA = as.factor(case_when(grepl("INDIA", toupper(Style)) ~ "Y", TRUE ~ "N")))
##Idenitify all beers containing the word "IPA", ignoring case. IPA is abreviation for Indian Pale Ale
IPA_Beers = Beers_Brewery_Omit %>% filter(grepl("IPA",Style, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>% mutate(IPA = "Y")
##Merge the 2 datasets together and distinct, excluding any overlapping records.
Ale_IPA_Beers = merge(Ale_Beers, IPA_Beers, all = TRUE)
Ale_IPA_Beers_Dist = Ale_IPA_Beers %>% distinct()
Fallout =  Beers_Brewery_Omit %>% anti_join(Ale_IPA_Beers, by = "Beer_ID") ##Rows that don't have 'NA' and do not have 'IPA' or not containing the whole word 'Ale'.
IPA_Base = Ale_IPA_Beers_Dist %>% select(ABV, IBU, IPA)
### Standardization of test data
IPA = as_tibble(data.frame(ABV = scale(IPA_Base$ABV),IBU = scale(IPA_Base$IBU),IPA = IPA_Base$IPA))
##Set data and parameters ready for KNN
set.seed(6)
splitPerc = .75
trainIndices = sample(1:dim(IPA)[1],round(splitPerc * dim(IPA)[1]))
train = IPA[trainIndices,]
test = IPA[-trainIndices,]
IPA %>% ggplot(aes(x = ABV,y=IBU,color = IPA)) + geom_point()
##Find best k for outcomes
iterations = 500
numks = 30
masterAcc = matrix(nrow = iterations, ncol = numks)
for(j in 1:iterations)
{
accs = data.frame(accuracy = numeric(30), k = numeric(30))
trainIndices = sample(1:dim(IPA)[1],round(splitPerc * dim(IPA)[1]))
train = IPA[trainIndices,]
test = IPA[-trainIndices,]
for(i in 1:numks)
{
  classifications = knn(train[,c(1,2)],test[,c(1,2)],train$IPA, prob = TRUE, k = i)
  table(classifications,test$IPA)
  CM = confusionMatrix(table(classifications,test$IPA))
  masterAcc[j,i] = CM$overall[1]
}

}
MeanAcc = colMeans(masterAcc)
plot(seq(1,numks,1),MeanAcc, type = "l")
###Observed best k is 19 based on 500 iterations.Based on misclassification analysis, we can conclude that k is 5 is the most optimum value as any value equal or greater than 19 yields significant increase misclassification. Therefore, we will take k=5 in our knn classification with accuracy of 87%, and precision of 84.7%, and recall of 93.8%.
##utilize best k
classifications = knn(train[,c(1,2)],test[,c(1,2)],train$IPA, prob = TRUE, k = 19)
table(classifications,test$IPA)
confusionMatrix(table(classifications,test$IPA))
table = table(classifications,test$IPA)
accuracy <- function(x){sum(diag(x)/(sum(rowSums(x)))) * 100}
accuracy(table)
prop.table(table)
```
In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this relationship (KNN is required) you may also feel free to supplement your response to this question with any other methods or techniques you have learned.  Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.  

```{r}
##Knn-Means to identify the best model
set.seed(500)
k.max <- 100
wss<- sapply(1:k.max,function(k){kmeans(IPA[,1:2],k,nstart = 5,iter.max = 200)$tot.withinss})
plot(1:k.max,wss, type= "b", xlab = "Number of clusters(k)", ylab = "Within cluster sum of squares")
icluster <- kmeans(IPA[,1:2],2,nstart = 20)
kmeans_matrix = table(icluster$cluster,IPA$IPA)
kmeans_matrix
###Observed best k-means is 30 based on 200 iterations. Our knn-means classification with a precision of 88.5% and recall of 83.5%. This model better with precision, but lacks recall.
```



```{r}
install.packages("neuralnet")
library(neuralnet)
nn <- neuralnet(IPA ~ ABV + IBU, data=train, hidden=c(2,1), linear.output=FALSE, threshold=0.01, stepmax = 1E+10, rep = 25)
nn$result.matrix
plot(nn)
nn$result.matrix


#Test the resulting output
temp_test <- subset(test, select = c("IBU","ABV"))
head(temp_test)
nn.results <- compute(nn, temp_test)
results <- data.frame(actual = test$IPA, prediction = nn.results$net.result)
results

roundedresults<-sapply(results,round,digits=0)
roundedresultsdf=data.frame(roundedresults)
attach(roundedresultsdf)
table(actual,prediction)
```

9. Knock their socks off!  Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in.  You must convince them why it is important and back up your conviction with appropriate statistical evidence. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
##Most common beer across the US in each state is the IPA, but not to be mistaken for the Traditional Pale Ale
## Group the container sizes for beers by state. Then identify the best selling container sizes for Ale and non-Ale beers
Containers_sub = Beers_Brewery_Omit %>% select(Ounces, State) 
## Subset of data with container and State
Container_sub = Containers_sub %>% mutate(Containers = as.factor(Ounces), State = as.factor(State))
as_tibble(Container_sub)
## Summerized the date and added a row count for container categories
Sum_Container_sub= Container_sub %>% count(State, Containers, sort = TRUE)
as_tibble(Sum_Container_sub)
## Sorting the data for beers
Sum_Container_sub_Sort = Sum_Container_sub[order(Sum_Container_sub$State, Sum_Container_sub$Containers),] 
as_tibble(Sum_Container_sub_Sort) 
## Most popular container for beer by State 
Sum_Container_sub_Sort_key = data.table(Sum_Container_sub_Sort, key = "State")
St_Cont_top = Sum_Container_sub_Sort_key[, head(.SD, 1), by = State]
## Plotting everything together
ggplot(data = St_Cont_top, aes(x = n, y = Containers)) + geom_point(aes( col = State), size = 3) + geom_text(aes(y = Containers, label = ifelse(n > 50 | Containers == 16 | Containers == 8.4, as.character(State),''), x = n)) + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "top")
## 12 ounce is the most popular container in United States as all states besides 3, 12-ounce container is ranked number one. Secondly, the beers are predominantly served in 12-ounce container in the most state as the graph shows that the number of beers in 12-ounce is much higher than those of 16-ounce.

```
